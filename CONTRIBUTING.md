- Include type hints where appropriate
- Update README.md if adding new features

### Code Structure

```python
"""Module docstring explaining the purpose."""
import standard_library
import third_party_library
from local_module import LocalClass

# Constants
CONSTANT_NAME = value


class MyClass:
    """Class docstring."""
    
    def __init__(self, param):
        """
        Initialize the class.
        
        Args:
            param (type): Description of parameter.
